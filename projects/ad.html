							<h3>Project Roles: Web Developer, UX/UI Designer</h3>

							<h3>Project Scope</h3>
							<p>This client needed a WordPress blog so he could share what he has learned while researching his own family history.</p>

							<h3>Project Goals</h3>
							<p>The blog had to be accessible, informative, and professional. This would be a website that his family, friends, and other members of the genealogy community would visit. Resources that would be shared included records, PDFs, presentations, podcasts, and more.</p>

							Some of the must-haves for the blog were:
							<ul>
								<li>Should be easy to navigate</li>
								<li>Should be able to grow easily with the addition of new content</li>
								<li>Should showcase various resources for website visitors</li>
								<li>Should have a professional design</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>The Process</h3>
							<p>I wanted to provide a design that was unique. I thought that the best solution for this project would be to create a custom WordPress theme from scratch.</p>

							<p>I also wanted to engage visitors with my client's content from their first visit. On the home page, the user would always see an image that represented the first post. Alongside of that image, he/she would see a short excerpt of the post content. By scrolling down the page (or clicking the "Read More" button), the user could read the full post. At the bottom of the page, the user could access previous posts that were published recently.</p>

							<p>Draft sketch of the home page.</p>

							<p>For the design, the client wanted to use royal blues and earthtones, reminiscent of the Toguna of Mali. With his colors, I was able to create several color palettes. I used his chosen one to create the final design.</p>

							<p>The chosen color palette!</p>

							<p>To incorporate his resources, I created a dedicated "Resources" page with sublinks to each type of resource. By categorizing the content based on type, users would be able to quickly find what they needed.</p>

							<img src="../images/portfolio/ad-resources.JPG" alt="Dropdown links for the Resources page" />
							<p>Dropdown links for the "Resources" page.</p>
							<p>To encourage engagement among website visitors, I included a section for "Recent Comments" on the home page. Other items on the right-hand side of the home page would make it easier for users to search for content and to find specific posts based on the published month or by the post category.</p>
