							<h1>Dark Chocolate Alchemist : Redesign</h1>
							<h3><a href="http://darkchocolatealchemist.com/"> Current Website</a> <span class="icon fa-external-link"></span></h3>
							<h4>Project Roles: Web Developer, UX/UI Designer</h4>
							<h3>System Scope</h3>
							<p>The website is a food science website that takes original food recipes and dissects them in order to explain the scientific concepts behind them. My responsibilities included designing and editing the code for the website's child theme (for Wordpress), editing photography with Adobe Photoshop, designing the logo and other graphical elements in Adobe Illustrator, and organizing the content.</p>

							<p>Dark Chocolate Alchemist was created four years ago and currently is in need of a redesign. I have developed "Phase II" goals to reflect the needs of that redesign.</p>

							<h3>Project Goals</h3>
							<h4>Phase I</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Create an online resource that teaches homecookers about the science of dessert making.</li>
								<li>Display recipes in a way that is easy to understand.</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Phase II</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Showcase the food photography of each recipe.</li>
								<li>Allow the ability to write personal blog posts alongside of recipes easily.</li>
								<li>Focus less on the sciece.</li>
							</ol>

							<!--<h3>User Research</h3>-->


							<h3>Task Analysis</h3>
							<h4>Phase II</h4>
							<p>Users of the current version of Dark Chocolate Alchemist range from their ... to their ... and spend most of their time on the ... and the ... pages. Bounce rates indicate that users would

							These users will be visiting the website in order to quickly find recipes that they can execute in their own kitchens. However, what will captivate them will be the beautiful photography and the intriguing, personal tales of the client.</p>

							<h3>Design Decisions</h3>
							<p>For the Dark Chocolate Alchemist redesign, I have decided to go with a minimalist approach for the design. I did this by visualizing elements in small chunks and using clear, descriptive headings and labels for each section.</p>

							<p>Since the client required that the new website focus on the photography of the food, I felt that ample whitespace was necessary to draw users in and entice them to stay. This supported my choice to create a light and simple design.</p>

							<p>Columns help clearly define the beginning and end of sections. Feedback is presented to the user in the form of link and button rollovers that reward the user with content when used.

							<h3>Wireframes/Prototypes</h3>

							</div>

							<p>When I initially started this project, I focused primarily on the needs of my client. Upon shifting this thinking to attaining a balance between the client and his users, I have been able to propose a usable solution that will fulfill not only his needs, but also will provide his users with a pleasant experience.</p>
