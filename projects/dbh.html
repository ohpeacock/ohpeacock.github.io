							<h3>Project Roles: Web Developer, UX/UI Designer</h3>

							<h3>Project Summary</h3>
							<p>Digital Black History is a free online searchable listing of digital Black History projects that have been created by individuals and institutions alike. It contains projects that may be of use to family historians, genealogists, and students. There are numerous projects about Black History out there, but it can be very difficult to find them. This website curates those resources and allows you to search for them so that you can supplement your research..</p>

							<h3>Project Goals</h3>
							<p>The website had to be straightforward to use. There are several genealogy research websites out there, but many of them are cluttered, outdated, and sometimes confusing to use. I wanted this website to be the complete opposite. </p>

							<p>I chose clean colors to emphasize a more minimalist style. Users would not struggle to find what they needed.</p>

							Some of the must-haves for the website were:
							<ul>
								<li>Should be easy to navigate</li>
								<li>Should have a professional design that is minimalist</li>
								<li>Should be able to dynamically show search results</li>
								<li>Should be easy to access the searchable resources</li>
							</ul>

							<p>I also wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn a new framework, specifically, <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>.</p>
							<h3>The Process</h3>

							<p>The website would only have a few pages, with the home page being the place that users would be spending most of their time.

							I started by creating the data schema. The data would be stored in a MySQL database. I would pull the data using Laravel/PHP.</p>

							<p>I used Webpack to manage my assets and refresh the screen as I developed.</p>
