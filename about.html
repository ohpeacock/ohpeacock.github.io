								<h1>Hi, my name is Olivia</h1>
								<p>I am first and foremost a user advocate.</p>

							</header>

							<p>I am an information and user experience professional. My formal training comes from the Bachelors and Masters degree programs at UNC Chapel Hill's School of Information and Library Science. It is here that I learned how to apply critical thinking to challenges posed by information systems, how to understand various information settings, and how to transform user needs into viable solutions. </p>

							<p>In my professional life, I honed these skills by constantly seeking new ways to support every user group that I interacted with. Here, I was able to perfect teasing out a users' needs from their wants, implementing or revisiting user solutions, and becoming a strong user advocate.

							<p>For the past couple of years, I have been working in the Health IT field. Having countless experiences with frustrated doctors and clinical staff made me wonder about the disconnect between EHR (electronic health record) vendors and their users. How do these vendors capture user input? What do their user testing processes look like? Having worked elbow-to-elbow with users for so long, I know that I am at the perfect intersection to solve these challenges.</p>

							<p>I will stand up for your users, and deliver results that enhance (not obstruct) their workflows with a smile and with confidence in our success. </p>
